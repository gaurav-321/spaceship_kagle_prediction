# ðŸš€ Spaceship Titanic Prediction

## Description
The Spaceship Titanic Prediction project is a machine learning endeavor focused on predicting whether passengers on the fictional Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension. This project leverages LightGBM and CatBoost models for classification, emphasizing robust feature engineering and data preprocessing.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Includes cabin splitting, spending features, group features, and categorical encoding.
- **Ensemble Model**: Combines predictions from LightGBM and CatBoost for improved accuracy.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Manages missing values with sensible defaults or imputation using RobustScaler.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gag3301v/spaceship_kagle_prediction.git
   cd spaceship_kagle_prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s how you can run the script:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load and preprocess data
train_data = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('data/test.csv')

# Run the main.py script
# python main.py
```

### Running Tests (if available)
If tests are included, you can run them using:
```bash
pytest
```
